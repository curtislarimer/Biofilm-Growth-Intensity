Brief description of Biofilm Growth Intensity program - 

The accumulation of bacteria in surface attached biofilms, or biofouling, can be detrimental to human health, dental hygiene, and many industrial processes. A critical need in identifying and preventing the deleterious effects of biofilms is the ability to observe and quantify their development. Analytical methods capable of assessing early stage fouling are cumbersome or lab-confined, subjective, and qualitative. The aim of this program is to use image analysis to enhance contrast of early stage biofouling. This program executes an algorithm developed to objectively and quantitatively measure surface accumulation of Pseudomonas putida from photographs. This simple method for early stage biofilm detection enables quantifiable measurement of surface fouling and is flexible enough to be applied from the laboratory to the field. 

A new method of image analysis using multilevel thresholding was developed to rapidly measure fouling in digital photographs. The analysis evaluates biofilm growth intensity (BGI) on sample coupons and assigns a simple, easy-to-understand value between zero and 100 that represents an absolute score for fouling intensity over the entire coupon. Measuring BGI allows direct, quantifiable, and robust comparison of fouling on different coupons. BGI is not just a measure of areal coverage of fouling: it also includes information about the density and thickness of surface growth.
